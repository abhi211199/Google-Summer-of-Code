## Refactor FLINT Core Code Base

**Description:** 

FLINT is an open source, modular tool that estimates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land by modeling the flux of GHG on millions (or even billions) of land parcels. This project idea is to refactor the code base of the core software tool to speed up processing. The code has to be hyper efficient as every microsecond too much is repeated millions of times. The maintainers will point out areas where the FLINT code can be made more efficient. The task at hand is to review these areas and implement code refactoring mainly to improve speed but also improving readability, identify vulnerabilities and prepare the code for further development.  As such we are seeking someone with an interest in quality code development and streamlining. See our web site and GitHub repositories for more information and examples.

**Pre-requisite skills:** 

Advanced experience with C++ and an understanding of simulation modelling will be required. Understanding of spatial and temporal data processing would be useful, but not essential.

**Difficulty level:** 

Hard
