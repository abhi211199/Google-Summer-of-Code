## Develop New Models for FLINT

**Description:** 

FLINT is a modular tool that supports better land management and helps reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide, and allows multiple models and data required to better understand land management land to be brought together in one place. This project idea is for implementation of new models to monitor land sector GHG emissions and support sustainable land management. There are already several existing models that have been attached, but many more are required to make the system complete. As such we are seeking coders with an interest in large scale data processing and modelling to help add more models. The models have already been identified by scientific experts, but they need to be re-coded, tested and made operational. Some examples are 1) forest growth models 2) crop growth models 3) fire emissions models. See our web site and GitHub repositories for more information and examples.

**Additional resources:** 

Direct links to existing models or criteria for models? Examples of the level/detail of modeling needed? Any documentation about the existing model approaches?

**Pre-requisite skills:** 

Experience with C++ and an understanding of simulation modelling will be required. Understanding spatial and temporal data processing would be useful, but not essential.

**Difficulty level:** 

Moderate
