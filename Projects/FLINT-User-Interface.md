## Develop FLINT User Interface

**Description:** 

FLINT is an open source, modular tool that estimates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land by modeling the flux of GHG on millions (or even billions) of land parcels. This project would be to help in transforming JSON input files used by the software into an intuitive user interface. Before the software can run, a large list of run options and input data has to be selected. Currently the input is provided through a JSON file. Based on this format an intuitive user interface needs to be developed providing all options and reducing the potential for faulty inputs. 

**Pre-requisite skills:** 

Experience with JS, PHP, and Python. Understanding of C++ is useful. Understanding spatial and temporal data processing would be useful, but not essential.

**Difficulty level:** 

Medium
